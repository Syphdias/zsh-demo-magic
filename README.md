# Zsh Demo Magic
Inspired by a talk from TODO (kubecon 2023 apple guy?) using demo-magic I wanted
to try to make it feel more like my normal zsh shell.

# About
I would have preferred to make this a executable script instead of needing to
source the file. However this is not possible as it needs to access variables
that could not be handed back up to the parent shell. (Or at least it would
introduce additional complexity, I would like to avoid.)
